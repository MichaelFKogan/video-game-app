// Camera to Storyline Feed

In my CameraButtonView, when the user takes a photo with the camera, or selects a photo from their library, and presses the Accept Photo Button, that photo is sent to the Runware.ai API.

That photo is transformed into a video game image by the Runware API, and returned in JSON as a URL.

I will need to save that image to storage or my database, and connect it to the user, so that when they return to the website, their images will be loaded from the database.

I believe I will need to create the photos table. You can see the potential schema below.

Each image will contain a variety of information, user-generated title, description, if the image is public or not, xp points, other types of points, as well as information I'm nott sure about yet but will probably be adding to it later

Step 2: Set Up Database Tables
    Create tables in Supabase:

    users table

    id → uuid (matches Supabase Auth ID)
    username
    profilePhotoURL

    photos table

    id
    user_id → links to users table
    image_url
    is_public → boolean
    created_at
    description

I also need to take that converted response image, and display it on the GalleryView() page.

How can I get started setting this up?

I'm not sure how to do any of this or if and how I should use Supabase storage.

Do you need to see my code?
